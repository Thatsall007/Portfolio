										As part of my project in financial data analysis, I am utilizing Python to analyze historical stock data. The project involves multiple steps to clean, process, and visualize the data, along with creating a simple trading strategy based on moving averages.
										
										I am starting by using the `yfinance` library to download historical stock data, focusing on the daily closing prices. After retrieving the data, I am performing data cleaning by handling missing values and removing duplicates to ensure the dataset is accurate and ready for analysis.
										
										<br><br>Next, I am visualizing the trends in the stock's closing prices using Matplotlib. This is helping me identify the overall movement of the stock over time, providing valuable insights for further analysis.
										
										For technical analysis, I am computing moving averages using Pandas. Moving averages are crucial in identifying trends in stock price movements, so I am applying both short-term and long-term moving averages to the dataset.
										
										Building on this, I am implementing a simple trading strategy using moving average crossover logic. This involves generating "Buy" and "Sell" signals based on the point where the short-term moving average crosses above or below the long-term moving average. I am adding these signals as new columns in the dataset to provide actionable insights.
										
										<br><br>Finally, I am visualizing the stock price chart with the generated Buy and Sell signals overlaid. This visual representation is making it easy to track potential trading opportunities and analyze how the moving averages are performing in real-time market conditions.
										
										Through this process, I am gaining valuable experience in data manipulation, technical analysis, and financial data visualization.</p>

                                            <strong>Data Science Intern</strong> <br>
                                            <span style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8em;">My Analytics School   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   (Jun 2024- Aug 2024)</span></h2>
									<p>Leading a team of eight members, the project involved extracting data from over 100 companies using BeautifulSoup as the primary web scraping tool. This process required coordination, technical expertise, and efficient workflows to gather and organize valuable data. The structured data provided critical insights for business analysis and decision-making while showcasing the ability to manage and deliver large-scale data-driven projects. <br><br> 

                                    The team developed a RAG-based (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot leveraging advanced frameworks such as Langchain and Ollama. Chroma was utilized for vector databases, and LLMs (Large Language Models) were implemented for embeddings to enhance the chatbot's response capabilities. This cutting-edge approach enabled the chatbot to retrieve accurate information dynamically, offering a powerful and efficient solution for complex user queries.   <br><br> 

									To further enhance the chatbot’s performance, a Cross Encoder was integrated as a re-ranker, significantly improving the accuracy to 92%. This optimization ensured more precise and contextually relevant responses, demonstrating expertise in fine-tuning machine learning models. The improvement underscored the ability to deliver high-performing AI solutions tailored to user needs, reinforcing the project's overall success.  <br><br>   

									The project also involved designing an intuitive user interface using Streamlit, enabling users to input multiple PDFs seamlessly. This functionality was successfully deployed on an AWS EC2 instance, ensuring accessibility and scalability. The deployment highlighted the integration of robust backend processing with a user-friendly front end, delivering a reliable, cloud-based solution for document-based data retrieval.</p>

									<p>The task began with extracting and analyzing data related to inward remittances to India, a key economic indicator. By leveraging Power BI, an automated dashboard was developed to visualize the data effectively, enabling real-time tracking and analysis. This tool provided stakeholders with valuable insights into remittance trends, simplifying decision-making processes and improving operational efficiency in the financial domain. The automation reduced manual work, enhanced accuracy, and ensured timely reporting of critical information. <br> <br>

									Marketing efforts were significantly improved through the adoption of data-driven strategies aimed at market expansion. By analyzing customer behavior, market trends, and regional opportunities, targeted campaigns were designed to maximize impact. This approach not only optimized marketing investments but also identified high-potential markets for growth. These strategies helped the organization expand its reach and strengthen its market presence, driving overall business growth.  <br>

									<br>The role also involved leading curriculum innovation initiatives, where educational or training programs were designed and improved iteratively based on stakeholder feedback. This process ensured the content remained relevant, engaging, and aligned with market demands. By continuously refining the curriculum, the organization saw increased user satisfaction and engagement, which contributed to enhanced profitability and long-term growth.  <br><br>

									Additionally, competitive analysis and SWOT insights were performed to guide product development and strategy. This involved evaluating the organization’s position relative to competitors, identifying strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, and using this information to refine products and services. These analyses enabled the company to anticipate market trends, address challenges proactively, and deliver offerings that met customer expectations, solidifying its competitive advantage.</p>
