                                            <strong>Data Science Intern</strong> <br>
                                            <span style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8em;">My Analytics School   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   (Jun 2024- Aug 2024)</span></h2>
									<p>1. Leading a team of eight members, the project involved extracting data from over 100 companies using BeautifulSoup as the primary web scraping tool. This process required coordination, technical expertise, and efficient workflows to gather and organize valuable data. The structured data provided critical insights for business analysis and decision-making while showcasing the ability to manage and deliver large-scale data-driven projects. <br><br> 

                                    2. The team developed a RAG-based (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot leveraging advanced frameworks such as Langchain and Ollama. Chroma was utilized for vector databases, and LLMs (Large Language Models) were implemented for embeddings to enhance the chatbot's response capabilities. This cutting-edge approach enabled the chatbot to retrieve accurate information dynamically, offering a powerful and efficient solution for complex user queries.   <br><br> 

									3. To further enhance the chatbot’s performance, a Cross Encoder was integrated as a re-ranker, significantly improving the accuracy to 92%. This optimization ensured more precise and contextually relevant responses, demonstrating expertise in fine-tuning machine learning models. The improvement underscored the ability to deliver high-performing AI solutions tailored to user needs, reinforcing the project's overall success.  <br><br>   

									4. The project also involved designing an intuitive user interface using Streamlit, enabling users to input multiple PDFs seamlessly. This functionality was successfully deployed on an AWS EC2 instance, ensuring accessibility and scalability. The deployment highlighted the integration of robust backend processing with a user-friendly front end, delivering a reliable, cloud-based solution for document-based data retrieval.</p>

									<p>1. The task began with extracting and analyzing data related to inward remittances to India, a key economic indicator. By leveraging Power BI, an automated dashboard was developed to visualize the data effectively, enabling real-time tracking and analysis.

This approach not only optimized marketing investments but also identified high-potential markets for growth. These strategies helped the organization expand its reach and strengthen its market presence, driving overall business growth.  <br>

									<br>3. The role also involved leading curriculum innovation initiatives, where educational or training programs were designed and improved iteratively based on stakeholder feedback. This process ensured the content remained relevant, engaging, and aligned with market demands. By continuously refining the curriculum, the organization saw increased user satisfaction and engagement, which contributed to enhanced profitability and long-term growth.  <br><br>

									4. Additionally, competitive analysis and SWOT insights were performed to guide product development and strategy. This involved evaluating the organization’s position relative to competitors, identifying strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, and using this information to refine products and services. These analyses enabled the company to anticipate market trends, address challenges proactively, and deliver offerings that met customer expectations, solidifying its competitive advantage.</p>
