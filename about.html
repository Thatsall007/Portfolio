									<p>

										I am an AI and Machine Learning enthusiast with a strong foundation in data science, analytics, and problem-solving. My journey in technology started with a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering and has continued with a Master's degree in Applied Mechanics at IIT Madras, where I have been able to deepen my understanding of advanced computational techniques and their applications in real-world challenges. My academic journey, coupled with securing an All-India Rank of 848 in GATE 2023, reflects my dedication and passion for continuous learning and growth.
										
										<br><br>Throughout my educational and professional experiences, I have been involved in cutting-edge projects such as using Fourier Neural Operators to predict the mechanical properties of composite materials, time series analysis for air pollution forecasting, and building AI-powered solutions like chatbots and sentiment analysis models. These projects reflect my commitment to integrating AI and ML into practical domains, aiming for solutions that push technological boundaries.
										
										<br><br>In addition to my academic and professional pursuits, I have developed a keen interest in the fast-evolving field of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs). I enjoy reading blogs to stay updated with the latest trends and research, and I regularly contribute my insights by writing on Medium, where I share my learnings and experiences in AI, ML, and LLMs. Writing and reading blogs helps me consolidate my knowledge while staying connected with the AI community.
										
										With a curious and collaborative mindset, I seek to contribute to the ever-growing AI ecosystem, solving complex problems and creating impactful solutions.<br><br> My goal is to continue exploring innovative applications in AI and to be part of shaping the future of generative technologies and intelligent systems.
